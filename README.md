# Go.Data - DHIS2 Interoperability App

## Introduction

The Go.Data-DHIS2 Interoperability App enables metadata to be securely exchanged between [Go.Data](https://www.who.int/tools/godata), an outbreak response tool developed by WHO, and [DHIS2](https://dhis2.org/), a widely used system for national health information management developed by the University of Oslo. This includes bi-directional exchange of reference metadata used across both platforms (i.e., location hierarchies, facility lists); and case/contact data (cases being registered and investigated; and their contacts who are being listed and traced). Such an integration enables field teams to make use of additional visualizations for chains of transmission and contact tracing follow up in Go.Data during an acute outbreak scenario while ensuring key field intel gets reflected back into overarching DHIS2 system.
