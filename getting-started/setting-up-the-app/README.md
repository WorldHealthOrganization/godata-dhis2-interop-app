# Setting Up the App

The app configuration should only need to be done once, at installation time, by your DHIS2 administrator. It is key that the person configuring the app is aware of the use-case and metadata collected by both DHIS2 and Go.Data.

There are three things that need to be configured before using the app to transfer data between DHIS2 and Go.Data. First, it's necessary to connect the app to the Go.Data and DHIS2 instances. Then, we need to configure the two types of elements present in the app: Metadata Mappings, and Interoperability Tasks.
