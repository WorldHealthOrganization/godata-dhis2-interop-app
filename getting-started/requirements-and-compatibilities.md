# Requirements and Compatibilities

## Requirements and compatibilities

The app requires one functioning instance of DHIS2 and one of Go.Data from which to exchange data. The app is currently compatible with Go.Data V40.1 and above (testing to be performed for lower versions), and compatible with DHIS2 versions 2.34 and above. Also, it is currently compatible with the DHIS2 Tracker and Event Capture modules, across all types of Program Attributes and Data Elements.
