# App Functionalities

## Main functionality

The app consists of a main menu from which we can navigate to the four panels of the app where we can set our configuration and perform various actions.

1. **Go.Data Configuration panel**: It's used to configure the connection to the Go.Data server with which you want to exchange data with. The user's Go.Data credentials need to be introduced here.
2. **DHIS2 Configuration panel**: It's used to configure the connection to the DHIS2 server. The user's DHIS credentials need to be introduced here for the app to work.
3. **Metadata Mapping panel**: It's used to create, modify, or delete metadata mappings. For all mappings, and throughout subsequent system development, dot notation is used (a way of accessing JSON objects of any depth).
4. **Interoperability Tasks panel**: It's used to add and manage tasks for data exchange across platforms.
